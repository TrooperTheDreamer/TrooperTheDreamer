I met computers at a very young age thanks to the wonderful video games of the era. When I was a child I kept visiting my father's office to spend more time with his PC until I got mine. Pretty soon I made up my mind to work with computers and started learning programming by myself.

As a software developer I have work experience with companies and also as a freelancer. I mostly develop desktop applications on Windows. I'm fluent in C++ and I have solid knowledge on data structures, algorithms and design patterns. The area that I love the most is graphics programming.

I also have call center experience on software support. I worked as an AppleCare Advisor for a European company. I was helping customers on the phone line to find solutions to their software and hardware related problems for their Apple products.

I lived or/and worked in countries such as Turkey, Cyprus, Greece and USA. Please visit my personal web site for obtaining more information about me and my work.
